special interest in epilepsy. Along with the great people in the lab, we try to understand what causes some specific brain lesions to be epileptogenic, how this process evolves over time, and how it affects cognitive abilities. Some of these questions can be addressed in clinical research, but when it is not possible, we turn to animal models, where we have more control, and are able to use other methods on top of MRI. So much work on the temporal lobe has piqued my interest in how the auditory cortices make sense of acoustic stimuli that vary over time, a topic we have investigated using functional MRI. I joined the National Autonomous University of Mexico in 2010, and started the Brain Connectivity Laboratory in 2012. The type of work that I most enjoy is multidisciplinary by nature, and I have the fortune of having great collaborators.\n\nSInce 2014, I lead the National Laboratory for magnetic resonance imaging, which serves several research groups from all over Mexico.

In particular, the group is looking at the relationship between structural perturbations, lesions in patients, and investigating mechanisms of the reorganization of functional connectivity using Computational Modeling and noninvasive probes.  He has made several key contributions to understanding the computational role of time delay, time-scale separation, structure-function relationship, and plasticity that unfolds in a dynamical landscape in the brain.

brain injury (TBI) and co-occurring psychiatric sequelae. A better understanding the of the neuroscience underlying these illnesses will allow us to create better treatments to improve the lives of many and advance the field of psychiatry. I am a neuropsychiatrist with advanced training in the clinical care of those with complex neuropsychiatric conditions. I completed a Psychiatry Residency followed by a Clinical Neuroscience and Neuropsychiatry research fellowship at Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine. \nI am a full time employee of the Hines VA. I work as a clinician 25% of the time, splitting my time between the neuromodulation service (performing electroconvulsive and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapies) and outpatient clinic. I also serve as the team psychiatrist on the Hines VA polytrauma team, the team that caters to the complex needs of Veterans with TBI. 75% of my time is devoted to research endeavors.

She has a strong interest in how cognitive processes develop over age, and in how research on atypical development illuminates the vulnerable aspects of cognitive development pathways. Research in the lab currently focuses on the development of executive functions and reading in late childhood and early adolescence. Dr. Church-Lang is head of the Austin neuroimaging site of the Texas Learning Disabilities Research Center project on reading intervention and brain change (texasldcenter.org). We’re particularly focused on how networks of the brain involved in task control relate to academic skill development and skill improvement over time.  As part of the reading-intervention project, as well as in our other research efforts in children with attention and learning disorders, we are focusing on brain and behavioral changes over two time periods: over the course of an intervention, and over the course of early puberty. To address these questions, we use behavioral methods such as cognitive tests (where we measure response times, accuracy on tasks, or eye movements), actigraphy (where we measure activity levels during sleep and wake), pubertal hormone assessments, neuropsychological assessments, neuroimaging (fMRI, resting-state fcMRI), and studies of patient populations (e.g. children with Tourette syndrome, ADHD, or dyslexia).","lat":30.26715,"lng":-97.74306,"showOnMap":true},"private":{"position":"Associate Professor","aup":true,"purpose":"We're hoping to use brainlife to work on DTI collaborations."},"admin":{}},"sub":1675,"times":{"register":"2021-06-23T19:39:20.580Z","confirm_email":"2021-06-23T19:44:45.492Z","local_login":"2021-06-25T02:43:23.437Z"},"username":"jacl","fullname":"Jessica Church","email":"church@austin.utexas.edu"},{"_id":"60d43974dc553e843863276f","ext":{"x509dns":[],"openids":[]},"email_confirmed":true,"active":true,"scopes":{"brainlife":["user"]},"profile":{"public":{"institution":"Philips Research","bio":"Scientist working on Neurological and Psychiatrics disorders","lat":42.37242550000001,"lng":-71.0744466,"showOnMap":true},"private":{"aup":true,"position":"Scientist","purpose":"I'm testing the platform, to see if we can recommend it to scientist we work with (for their own purposes)"}},"sub":1676,"times":{"register":"2021-06-24T07:51:16.818Z","confirm_email":"2021-06-24T07:51:43.996Z"},"username":"huijbers","fullname":"Willem Huijbers","email":"willem.huijbers@philips.com"},{"_id":"60d4903fdc553ecfe7632770","ext":{"x509dns":[],"openids":[]},"email_confirmed":true,"active":true,"scopes":{"brainlife":["user"]},"profile":{"public":{"institution":"the University of Texas at Austin","bio":"UX Designer","lat":30.2793603,"lng":-97.7430115,"showOnMap":true},"private":{"position":"Master students","purpose":"I'd like to use Brainlife to examine the resting status of brain, preprocessing images and carrying out high-level overview and analyses.","aup":true},"admin":{}},"sub":1677,"times":{"register":"2021-06-24T14:01:34.925Z","confirm_email":"2021-06-24T14:04:45.905Z","local_login":"2021-08-09T04:19:18.090Z"},"username":"francesWong","fullname":"Frances Wong","email":"yiyanhuang1010@gmail.com"},{"_id":"60d5ad3bdc553e0be1632774","ext":{"x509dns":[],"openids":[]},"email_confirmed":true,"active":true,"scopes":{"brainlife":["user"]},"profile":{"public":{"institution":"Freie Universitaet Berlin","bio":"I am a PhD student in Neural Dynamics of Visual Cognition group, at Freie Universitaet Berlin.

Leveraging those qualifications and industry experience in Computer Science, Oren’s focus is on developing multimodal neuroimaging analysis tools based, in part, on the MRtrix software, including diffusion MRI combined with fMRI (continuing from his previous position at the University of Sydney), and diffusion MRI combined with MEG (current position). These efforts parallel his research interest in elucidating the brain’s connectivity network on multiple dimensions (conduction speed, throughput, redundancy, etc.) in order to develop more accurate diagnoses and more targeted/personalised treatment of brain disorders.

He also has (co)authored over 80 peer-review scientific journal articles and book chapters, helped generate millions of US dollars in research funding, licensed several patents, and received multimedia news attention from Reuters, American Psychological Association, Discover Magazine, The Pharmaceutical Journal, The Scientist, Science, Air & Space Magazine, Fox News, Nature Neuropod, National Geographic, The Atlantic, NPR’s Morning Edition, and other sources for his collaborative science, business, and charitable activities.\n\nDr. Clark has spent much of his research career using his training in disciplines of engineering, psychology, biochemistry/biophysics, physiology, neuroscience, and microbiology to study the evolution and biological basis of learning, memory, and intelligence. Dr. Clark’s award-winning research and patented inventions improving learning, memory, and recovery from traumatic brain injury through peripheral neuromodulation gained recognition from MacArthur fellow Dr. James McGaugh and other members of the National Academy of Sciences, USA. This work was instrumental in the US Food and Drug Administration’s decision to approve Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) for complex-partial seizures – the only medical device therapy currently marketed for treatment of convulsive epilepsy – and has encouraged potential derivative VNS indications for Alzheimer's disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, and tinnitus, among other pathologies. The same research helped motivate launch of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Targeted Neuroplasticity Training Program in 2016. Later comparative primate studies conducted with systems neuroscientist Dr. Nikos Logothetis focused on Dr. Clark’s interests in the neural basis of cognition across animal phylogeny, particularly cross-taxa models of perceptual and conceptual priming. Some of this research inspired Dr. Clark’s current work into digital health and neuroedutechnologies, natural and technology-based classical and quantum Hebbian learning in cognitive processing, nonrelativistic and relativistic information processing in spatial cognition, and entropic uncertainty in language privatization, disambiguation, and structure. His broader interests in the evolution of intelligent behavior largely began in graduate school while working with molecular and cellular evolutionist Dr. Sidney Fox, student and colleague of Nobelists Thomas Hunt Morgan and Linus Pauling, on protocell models of plasticity and communication and continue today with studies involving microbial sociality. By creating paradigms comparing microbial goal-directed behavior with animal decision making, Dr. Clark has shown microbes learn to simulate soft-matter quantum computers. These computational abilities, conforming to attributes of quantum Hebbian networks, putatively stem from intracellular signaling mediated by phylogenetically ubiquitous receptor-dependent fire-diffuse-fire Ca2+ reactions and quantum/classical molecular logic and memory systems. The major implications of Dr. Clark’s ground-breaking findings regarding microbial behavior and physiology have been acknowledged by noted experts worldwide for providing fundamental insights into cellular response regulation and into sensor, command, and control platforms useful for next-generation smart medical, industrial, and national defense nano/microbiotechnologies. His work extends to many topics, including, but not limited to, host-parasite and pathogen-pathogen interactions, cellular decision making, natural and “cognitive” computing, pharmaceutical and epidemiological control of infectious diseases, neural and aneural plasticity, neuromorphic architectures, learning and memory, problem solving, perception, information representation and processing, social behavior, adaptation to extreme environments, emergence of evolutionary and developmental transitions, sustainable human development, protection of endangered cultural heritages and diversity, ecosystem conservation and resource management, green energy production, bioremediation and -extraction, theragnostic and regenerative medicine, origins of life, and astrobiology.\n\nMoreover, as a peer-respected and award-winning scientist, technologist, educator, community liaison, and business leader, Dr. Clark demonstrates a history of creating local to global (urban and rural) community outreach, educational, and business programs that improve career pipelines and workforce diversity, personalized and team instruction, discovery culture, organization scaling and branding, and product/services design, development, and commercialization in STEAM fields of interest. His past and current work, in collaboration with professional societies, corporate technology giants, world-class tertiary academic/research institutions, government agencies, community-centered organizations, and public school districts, stimulate STEAM innovation by establishing progressive government-industry-academia-community partnerships, special student/professional curricular and entrepreneurial programs, and advanced interactive (cognitive computing- and neuroscience-based) behavioral design, performance, and assessment methods. These endeavors, though framed within a larger geosocioeconomic mission and discourse, often take the form of small local or regional reform action beneficial for crafting stronger business and education strategies, policies, practices, and long-term positive out-comes for stakeholders and society, such as inspiring, informing, and enabling generations of people for better problem assessment and understanding, innovative solution discovery, and systematic preparedness, responsiveness, and resolution to some of Humanity's grand challenges."},"private":{"position":"Past SAB Chair, Domain Champion in Biomedicine, Neurology Subgroup Lead, Faculty and Member, Member","orcid":"0000-0003-0544-2150","purpose":"I am interested in using brainlife to help develop technologies, data, and findings important for better understanding of brain function and structure, development, and disease, injury, and recovery.
