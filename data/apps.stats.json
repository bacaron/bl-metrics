It generates a large set of candidate streamlines using a tensor-based deterministic model, csd-based deterministic model, and csd-based probabilistic model. The csd-based models can be computed at lmax values of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. All candidate streamlines are combined into a single track.mat file.

If you have ACPC aligned your t1 images using the ACPC alignment app on Brain Life the following values are a good starting point: coronal = 105, sagittal = 89, axial = 65. The img_min and img_max values refer to the value range displayed for the t1 image. The value range is calulated as follow (mean + img_min * std, mean + img_max * std). The default values are a good starting place, adjust them if your t1 is too dark or too light.","tags":["quality-check"],"stats":{"stars":0},"contributors":[{"name":"Lindsey Kitchell","email":null},{"name":"Soichi Hayashi","email":"hayashis@iu.edu"}]},"runtime_mean":836945.26,"runtime_std":3314536.152102724,"resources":[{"resource_id":"5943cd40055b490021abb7b6","name":"Carbonate @ IU","_id":"64e2e6b99bb35f04554bd583"},{"resource_id":"61005350b5554234facf0cec","name":"quartz @ IU","_id":"64e2e6b99bb35f04554bd584"}],"examples":5,"groups":38},"create_date":"2020-04-10T20:01:53.595Z","doi":"10.25663/brainlife.app.310"},{"name":"Plot response function","github":"brainlife/app-plot-response","desc":null,"stats":{"success_rate":89.36170212765957,"users":17,"runtime_mean":386891.32,"runtime_std":974116.962767746,"requested":1248,"resources":[{"resource_id":"5943cd40055b490021abb7b6","name":"Carbonate @ IU","_id":"64e2e6bf9bb35f04554bd6f1"}],"examples":3,"groups":28},"create_date":"2020-04-11T20:09:37.012Z","doi":"10.25663/brainlife.app.311"},{"name":"Generate images of tissue type masks","github":"brainlife/app-slicer-fsl","desc":null,"stats":{"success_rate":82.34867047826482,"users":125,"runtime_mean":40597.75,"runtime_std":27729.495422158332,"requested":23578,"resources":[{"resource_id":"5943cd40055b490021abb7b6","name":"Carbonate @ IU","_id":"64e2e6c59bb35f04554bd737"},{"resource_id":"6022ea9f8b3974517723692e","name":"Bridges2 @ PSC (RM-Shared)","_id":"64e2e6c59bb35f04554bd738"},{"resource_id":"61005350b5554234facf0cec","name":"quartz @ IU","_id":"64e2e6c59bb35f04554bd739"}],"examples":2,"groups":195},"create_date":"2020-04-12T01:46:21.788Z","doi":"10.25663/brainlife.app.312"},{"name":"combineROI","github":"svincibo/app-combineROI","desc":"This app will merge two ROI datatype sets into one ROI datatype dataset.","stats":{"success_rate":90.25133282559025,"users":4,"runtime_mean":40018.73,"runtime_std":126192.00392535611,"requested":1411,"resources":[{"resource_id":"61005350b5554234facf0cec","name":"quartz @ IU","_id":"64e2e6cd9bb35f04554bdb6b"}],"examples":5,"groups":7},"create_date":"2020-04-13T22:21:32.418Z","doi":"10.25663/brainlife.app.313"},{"name":"mergeROI","github":"svincibo/app-mergeROI","desc":null,"stats":{"success_rate":97.32620320855615,"users":3,"runtime_mean":1369309.26,"runtime_std":4204635.105033748,"requested":881,"resources":[{"resource_id":"5943cd40055b490021abb7b6","name":"Carbonate @ IU","_id":"64e2e6d29bb35f04554bdb6f"}],"examples":0,"groups":4},"create_date":"2020-04-13T23:39:58.835Z","doi":"10.25663/brainlife.app.314"},{"name":"pRFLife with mrTools","github":"davhunt/app-prfv2","desc":null,"stats":{"success_rate":31.57894736842105,"users":1,"runtime_mean":85804083.08333333,"runtime_std":112690653.6729291,"requested":47,"resources":[{"resource_id":"61005350b5554234facf0cec","name":"quartz @ IU","_id":"64e2e6d79bb35f04554bdb72"}],"examples":0,"groups":1},"create_date":"2020-04-14T19:49:34.816Z","doi":"10.25663/brainlife.app.315"},{"name":"Merge ROIs (Sophia)","github":"brainlife/app-merge-rois","desc":null,"stats":{"success_rate":55.55555555555556,"users":1,"runtime_mean":77038.2,"runtime_std":21479.396038064013,"requested":9,"resources":[],"examples":0,"groups":1},"create_date":"2020-04-20T02:47:53.220Z","doi":"10.25663/brainlife.app.316"},{"name":"Generate image of ODF","github":"brainlife/app-plot-odf","desc":null,"stats":{"success_rate":6.442880346507851,"users":8,"runtime_mean":41179.64,"runtime_std":57329.478174761025,"requested":1894,"resources":[{"resource_id":"61005350b5554234facf0cec","name":"quartz @ IU","_id":"64e2e6e19bb35f04554bdc0a"}],"examples":1,"groups":11},"create_date":"2020-04-20T05:19:02.677Z","doi":"10.25663/brainlife.app.317"},{"name":"Whole Brain Tractography","github":"brainlife/app-mrtrix3-act","desc":"Runs mrtrix3 ACT (Anatomically Constrained Tractography) using either single- or multi-shell diffusion-weighted MRI data.
