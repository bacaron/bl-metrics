This application computes the Laplace-Beltrami spectrum using a linear finite element method, following the definitions and steps given in Reuter et al.'s 2009 paper: \"Discrete Laplace-Beltrami Operators for Shape Analysis and Segmentation\". Options for normalization are: None, \"area\", \"index\", \"areaindex\". Normalization by area uses the area of the 2D structure as in Reuter et al. 2006. Normalization by index will divide the eigenvalues by their index to account for linear increase of Eigenvalue magnitude (Weyl's law in 2D) as suggested in Reuter et al. (2006) and used in BrainPrint (Wachinger et al. 2015). The default is areaindex, which will do both. References (please cite when using for publication): Martin Reuter et al.

The csd-based models can be computed at lmax values of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. All candidate streamlines are combined into a single track.mat file.

If you have ACPC aligned your t1 images using the ACPC alignment app on Brain Life the following values are a good starting point: coronal = 105, sagittal = 89, axial = 65. The img_min and img_max values refer to the value range displayed for the t1 image. The value range is calulated as follow (mean + img_min * std, mean + img_max * std). The default values are a good starting place, adjust them if your t1 is too dark or too light.","tags":["quality-check"],"stats":{"stars":0},"contributors":[{"name":"Lindsey Kitchell","email":null},{"name":"Soichi Hayashi","email":"hayashis@iu.edu"}]},"runtime_mean":1066784.82,"runtime_std":2240482.604576279,"resources":[{"resource_id":"5943cd40055b490021abb7b6","name":"Carbonate @ IU","_id":"624c75fffa12c2470ac0ff29"},{"resource_id":"5e8786cd93735e4a42d2e229","name":"Jetstream/slurm8 @ TACC","_id":"624c75fffa12c2470ac0ff2a"}],"examples":5,"groups":30},"create_date":"2020-04-10T20:01:53.595Z","doi":"10.25663/brainlife.app.310"},{"name":"Plot response function","github":"brainlife/app-plot-response","desc":null,"stats":{"success_rate":89.21282798833819,"users":15,"runtime_mean":397871.29,"runtime_std":1256057.5189167918,"requested":1096,"resources":[{"resource_id":"5943cd40055b490021abb7b6","name":"Carbonate @ IU","_id":"624c7619fa12c2470ac1035e"},{"resource_id":"5e8786cd93735e4a42d2e229","name":"Jetstream/slurm8 @ TACC","_id":"624c7619fa12c2470ac1035f"}],"examples":5,"groups":26},"create_date":"2020-04-11T20:09:37.012Z","doi":"10.25663/brainlife.app.311"},{"name":"Generate images of tissue type masks","github":"brainlife/app-slicer-fsl","desc":null,"stats":{"success_rate":81.19874142466601,"users":96,"runtime_mean":255373.82,"runtime_std":1189441.8418630594,"requested":20907,"resources":[{"resource_id":"5943cd40055b490021abb7b6","name":"Carbonate @ IU","_id":"624c762afa12c2470ac1059a"},{"resource_id":"5e8786cd93735e4a42d2e229","name":"Jetstream/slurm8 @ TACC","_id":"624c762afa12c2470ac1059b"},{"resource_id":"5e87a46d93735e1592d2e485","name":"Jetstream/slurm9 @ TACC","_id":"624c762afa12c2470ac1059c"}],"examples":3,"groups":144},"create_date":"2020-04-12T01:46:21.788Z","doi":"10.25663/brainlife.app.312"},{"name":"combineROI","github":"svincibo/app-combineROI","desc":"This app will merge two ROI datatype sets into one ROI datatype dataset.","stats":{"success_rate":96.51474530831099,"users":3,"runtime_mean":267090.57,"runtime_std":2009536.6267781446,"requested":385,"resources":[{"resource_id":"5e8786cd93735e4a42d2e229","name":"Jetstream/slurm8 @ TACC","_id":"624c7638fa12c2470ac1078c"},{"resource_id":"61005350b5554234facf0cec","name":"quartz @ IU","_id":"624c7638fa12c2470ac1078d"}],"examples":1,"groups":5},"create_date":"2020-04-13T22:21:32.418Z","doi":"10.25663/brainlife.app.313"},{"name":"mergeROI","github":"svincibo/app-mergeROI","desc":null,"stats":{"success_rate":97.32620320855615,"users":3,"runtime_mean":1369309.26,"runtime_std":4204635.105033748,"requested":881,"resources":[{"resource_id":"5e8786cd93735e4a42d2e229","name":"Jetstream/slurm8 @ TACC","_id":"624c7640fa12c2470ac107ef"}],"examples":0,"groups":4},"create_date":"2020-04-13T23:39:58.835Z","doi":"10.25663/brainlife.app.314"},{"name":"pRFLife with mrTools","github":"davhunt/app-prfv2","desc":null,"stats":{"success_rate":32.432432432432435,"users":1,"runtime_mean":85804083.08333333,"runtime_std":112690653.6729291,"requested":46,"resources":[{"resource_id":"5e8786cd93735e4a42d2e229","name":"Jetstream/slurm8 @ TACC","_id":"624c7649fa12c2470ac10867"},{"resource_id":"61005350b5554234facf0cec","name":"quartz @ IU","_id":"624c7649fa12c2470ac10868"}],"examples":1,"groups":1},"create_date":"2020-04-14T19:49:34.816Z","doi":"10.25663/brainlife.app.315"},{"name":"Merge ROIs (Sophia)","github":"brainlife/app-merge-rois","desc":null,"stats":{"success_rate":55.55555555555556,"users":1,"runtime_mean":77038.2,"runtime_std":21479.396038064013,"requested":9,"resources":[],"examples":1,"groups":1},"create_date":"2020-04-20T02:47:53.220Z","doi":"10.25663/brainlife.app.316"},{"name":"Generate image of ODF","github":"brainlife/app-plot-odf","desc":null,"stats":{"success_rate":2.631578947368421,"users":6,"runtime_mean":205232.64516129033,"runtime_std":194080.14564832253,"requested":1215,"resources":[{"resource_id":"5e8786cd93735e4a42d2e229","name":"Jetstream/slurm8 @ TACC","_id":"624c7660fa12c2470ac10a88"},{"resource_id":"61005350b5554234facf0cec","name":"quartz @ IU","_id":"624c7660fa12c2470ac10a89"}],"examples":0,"groups":9},"create_date":"2020-04-20T05:19:02.677Z","doi":"10.25663/brainlife.app.317"},{"name":"Whole Brain Tractography","github":"brainlife/app-mrtrix3-act","desc":"Runs mrtrix3 ACT (Anatomically Constrained Tractography) using either single- or multi-shell diffusion-weighted MRI data.
